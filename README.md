# Algorithms and Complexity - Polynomial multiplication
This repository contains all figures used in my presentation about Polynomial multiplication on June 12, 2020. The assets are generated using the 
various python scripts in this repository and make use of few python libraries,
namely matplotlib and numpy.

## Introductory graphs
These graphs are generated in ``graphs.py`` and located in ``introductory_graphs/``.
- **linear_function.png** depicts $f(x)=x$
- **quadratic_function.png** shows $f(x)=x^2$
- **cubic_function.png** presents $f(x)=x^3$

## Motivation: Multidimensional polynomials 
These graphs are generated by ``multidimensional_graphs.py`` and the output files are located in ``motivation_graphs/``.
- **shape_1.png** 
- **shape_2.png** 

## Preliminaries: Complex nth roots of unity
These graphs are generated by ``roots_of_unity.py`` and the output files are located in ``preliminary_graphs/``.
- **roots_of_unity.png** shows the complex 5th roots of unity
